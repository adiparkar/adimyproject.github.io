    <p>Mobile Application Devlopment
        Mobile or Smartphones have become the most useful devices in this digital era. Nowadays, it transforms the whole world into a small global village. The course Mobile App Development, is about the development process of smart phones or other handheld devices. Mobile App (Application) Development course deals with the processes of developing applications for mobiles, smart phones, tablets, etc. The course covers the topics like, software development, mobile application development, web app development, mobile computing, android multimedia, iOS multimedia, app safety and security, app functionality, etc. There is no such eligibility to learn this course. But for the diploma, degree programs one must have to pass the 12th in any discipline (arts, science) from a recognized board. The employees of a company or industry also can learn this course. Some of the top course providers of Mobile App Development courses are Udemy, edX, Coursera, etc. The online courses can be learned remotely from all over the world. The course highlights are discussed below in detail.

    <h5>What is mobile application development?</h5>
       <p1>Mobile application development is the set of processes and procedures involved in writing software for small, wireless computing devices, such as smartphones and other hand-held devices.
        
        Like web application development, mobile application development has its roots in more traditional software development. One critical difference, however, is that mobile apps are often written specifically to take advantage of the unique features of a particular mobile device. For example, a gaming app might be written to take advantage of the iPhone's accelerometer or a mobile health app might be written to take advantage of a smartwatch's temperature sensor.</p1><br><br>
    <h5>Types of mobile applications:</h5>
           <p3> In the early years of mobile apps, the only way to ensure an app could perform optimally on any device was to develop the app natively. This meant that new code had to be written specifically for each device's specific processor. Today, the majority of mobile applications developed are device-agnostic.
            
            In the past, if an app needed to be cross-platform and run on multiple operating systems (OSes), there was little, if any, code that could be reused from the initial development project. Essentially, each device required its own mobile app development project with its own code base. Modern cross-platform tools use common languages such as C# and JavaScript to share code across projects; more importantly, they integrate well with application lifecycle management tools, such as Jenkins. This enables developers to use a single codebase for Apple iOS, Google Android and progressive web apps (PWAs). PWAs are built to take advantage of native mobile device features, without requiring the end user to visit an app store, make a purchase and download software locally. Instead, a PWA can be located with a search engine query and accessed immediately through a browser, thereby eliminating the need for e-commerce merchants to develop native apps for multiple mobile OSes.</p3>
