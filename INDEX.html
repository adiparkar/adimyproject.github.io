        <h4>Computer Science</h4>
    <p><u><b>Computer science</b></u> is the study of algorithmic processes, computing machines, and computation itself. As a discipline, computer science courses encompass a wide range of subjects, from the theoretical study of algorithms, computation, and information to practical problems of implementing computing systems in hardware and software.

      Computer science being an expansive field in the IT sector has led to a growth of many courses in computer science at all levels of study such as undergraduate, postgraduate, certification, doctorate, etc. Some of the best computer science courses are BTech Computer Science, Diploma in Computer Science, MTech Computer Science Engineering, etc. Check: Best Certificate Courses in Computer Science
      
      Eligibility criteria to pursue diploma and undergraduate programs in computer science is to secure a 50% aggregate score in class 12 exams and opt for Science (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics) stream. The eligibility criteria to pursue a master's or PhD course in computer science is to have a bachelor’s or master’s degree in computer science or related fields with more than 50% aggregate score respectively.</p>
